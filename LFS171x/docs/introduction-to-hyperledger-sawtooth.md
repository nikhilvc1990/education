# Introduction and Learning Objectives 

The Hyperledger Sawtooth chapter has been updated to Sawtooth v1.0 (as of May 2018). At this time, we were unable to update the videos introducing each section, so there may be some discrepancies. We apologize for the inconvenience, and we will update these videos in a future course version.
